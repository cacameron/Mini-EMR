1. We dicussed what we all wanted to do in class so we choose healthcare
2. We than had to think of what we wanted to do with health care so we decided on Mini EMR
3. Gathered what we needed for the EMR to work as a basic one
4. We split the task up into frontend, backend, and data base since you can't find a database to use
5. We picked what coding languages we are going to use
6. Front end is using HTML and CSS
7. Backend is using Python, and Mongodb
8. For the database we are using Mongodb
9. We divided our task into what people wanted to do and strenghts
10. We have one main person working on our front end
11. We have one main person working on our Backend
12. We have one person working on the data base that will help with front and backend coding to not have just one side drowing
13. For the data base we created people by randomly doing it
      for the people we have FirstName, LastName, Email, and password
            We have 50 people that we have randomly created
14. Mongodb:
      We created our own accounts
      Than made a cluster on mongodb and invited everyone to our cluster that is in our group
How to connect Mongodb to Visusal Studio Code: 
      We created a viritual enviroment in Visual studio:
For Mac Computers: 
      1. Open terminal and run command to create virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv   
      2. Run to activate the environment: source venv/bin/activate
      3. then we got the .env.example file and added the
            #connection string for python backend
            MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.yexocbd.mongodb.net/
      Rename file .env.example => .env
      Then, replace fields with our own MongoDB user credentials so it would look like:
                  MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.yexcdb.mongodb.net/
      4. Run to install libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
      6. Once we have those installed, run the script: python test_connection.py 
For Windows Computers: 
      1. Open new terminal and choose command prompt (default is powershell)
      2. Run the following commands: 
            a. Create the virtual env: py -m venv venv
            b. Activate the environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate
                  => you will know when you're in if you see (venv)
      3. Open the .env.example file and rename it as .env. Edit the connection string with database user credentials.
      4. Go back to terminal:
            a. Install the packages from the requirements.txt: pip install <package_name>
            b. Test the connection: py test_connection.py
            
15. We than ran the test_connection.py file to pull up the python database
