1. We dicussed what we all wanted to do in class so we choose healthcare
2. We than had to think of what we wanted to do with health care so we decided on Mini EMR
3. Gathered what we needed for the EMR to work as a basic one
4. We split the task up into frontend, backend, and data base since you can't find a database to use
5. We picked what coding languages we are going to use
6. Front end is using HTML and CSS
7. Backend is using Python, and Mongodb
8. For the database we are using Mongodb
9. We divided our task into what people wanted to do and strenghts
10. We have one main person working on our front end
11. We have one main person working on our Backend
12. We have one person working on the data base that will help with front and backend coding to not have just one side drowing
13. For the data base we created people by randomly doing it
      for the people we have FirstName, LastName, Email, and password
            We have 50 people that we have randomly created
