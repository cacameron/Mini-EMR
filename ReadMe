1. We dicussed what we all wanted to do in class so we choose healthcare
2. We than had to think of what we wanted to do with health care so we decided on Mini EMR
3. Gathered what we needed for the EMR to work as a basic one
4. We split the task up into frontend, backend, and data base since you can't find a database to use
5. We picked what coding languages we are going to use
6. Front end is using HTML and CSS
7. Backend is using Python, MAMP stack,PHP (server side), phpAdmin (managing SQL database)
8. For the database we are going MySQL
9. We divided our task into what people wanted to do and strenghts
10. We have one main person working on our front end
11. We have one main person working on our Backend
12. We have one person working on the data base that will help with front and backend coding to not have just one side drowing
13. For the data base we created people by randomly doing it
      for the people we have lastName, firstName, DOB, Gender, height, weight, allergies and Phone #
          so far for this we have 34 people that we have randomly created. For the phone # we typed 10 numbers so hopefully we don't have an actual phone number
14. Very import to do these installs for the backend or it will not work
      open Visual Studio code and make a file called backend.py
            than go to the terminal 
                  then you want to install python3 -m pip install pydantic fastapi uvicorn
                              after you did that and pip didn't work on the backend typing part do this install in ther termianl python3 -m pip --version
                        then uvicorn backend:app --reload
      and it will work how you want it to
