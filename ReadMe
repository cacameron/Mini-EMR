1. We dicussed what we all wanted to do in class so we choose healthcare
2. We than had to think of what we wanted to do with health care so we decided on Mini EMR
3. Gathered what we needed for the EMR to work as a basic one
4. We split the task up into frontend, backend, and data base since you can't find a database to use
5. We picked what coding languages we are going to use
6. Front end is using HTML and CSS
7. Backend is using Python, MAMP stack,PHP (server side), phpAdmin (managing SQL database
8. For the database we are going MySQL
