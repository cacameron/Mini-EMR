1. We dicussed what we all wanted to do in class so we choose healthcare
2. We than had to think of what we wanted to do with health care so we decided on Mini EMR
3. Gathered what we needed for the EMR to work as a basic one
4. We split the task up into frontend, backend, and data base since you can't find a database to use
5. We picked what coding languages we are going to use
6. Front end is using HTML and CSS
7. Backend is using Python, and Mongodb
8. For the database we are using Mongodb
9. We divided our task into what people wanted to do and strenghts
10. We have one main person working on our front end
11. We have one main person working on our Backend
12. We have one person working on the data base that will help with front and backend coding to not have just one side drowing
13. For the data base we created people by randomly doing it
      for the people we have FirstName, LastName, Email, and password
            We have 50 people that we have randomly created
14. Mongodb:
      We created our own accounts
      Than made a cluster on mongodb and invited everyone to our cluster that is in our group
How to connect Mongodb to Visusal Studio Code: 
      We created a viritual enviroment in Visual studio:
For Mac Computers: 
      1. Went to the terminal and typed python3 -m venv venv  and hit enter    
      2. Then we typed source venv/bin/activate  and also hit enter afterwards
      3. then we got the .env.example file and added the
            #connection string for python backend
            MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@cluster0.yexocbd.mongodb.net/
      This is an example but you would have to plug your own Mongodb information in. 
      We added our own information so it would look like //username:password@cluster0.yexcdb.mongodb.net/
      4. We had to install pip install python-dotenv
      5. Than we had to also install pip install pymongo 
      6. Once we got those installed on the termianl we ran the command python test_connection.py 
For Windows Comptuers: 
      1. Open new terminal and choose command prompt (default is powershell)
      2. Run the following commands: 
            a. Create the virtual env: py -m venv venv
            b. Activate the environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate
                  => you will know when you're in if you see (venv)
      3. Open the .env.example file and rename it as .env. Edit the connection string with database user credentials.
      4. Go back to terminal:
            a. Install the packages from the requirements.txt: pip install <package_name>
            b. Test the connection: py test_connection.py
            
15. We than ran the test_connection.py file to pull up the python database
